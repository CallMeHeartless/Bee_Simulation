# Bee_Simulation
A simple tech demo using Unity's ML-Agents to train bees to harvest nectar. This is a work in progress.

# Objective
Bee agents should be trained using a neural network to harvest nectar from flowers and return it to the hive. They should aim to collect as much nectar as possible before the scene resets. 

# Tech Demo:
The build is located under Bee Simulation > Bee Simulation Tech Demo 01.
Note: While the neural network is functional, is not perfect, and further training is required. In the event that the bee the camera is focused becomes stuck, the scene can be manually reset by pressing the R key.
